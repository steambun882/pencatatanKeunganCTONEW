# Firebase configuration templates

This directory contains scaffolding for the Firebase projects used by the app.
Use the `.example` files when provisioning real credentials with the
[FlutterFire CLI](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/cli/). Replace the
placeholder values with those generated for your Firebase projects and copy the
files into the native platform directories described in the root `README.md`.
