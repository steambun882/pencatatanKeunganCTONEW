# Firebase configuration

Copy the GoogleService-Info.plist generated by FlutterFire into this folder for
both development and production builds.

Suggested layout:

```
ios/Runner/Firebase/
├── dev/
│   └── GoogleService-Info.plist
└── prod/
    └── GoogleService-Info.plist
```

Use the templates in `firebase/dev` and `firebase/prod` as references. Update
your Xcode schemes to point to the correct file per build configuration.
